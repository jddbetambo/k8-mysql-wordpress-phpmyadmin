### PV and PVC - MySQL Deployment + Wordpress + PhpMyAdmin
The following config file describes a single-instance MySQL Deployment. The MySQL container mounts the PV at `/var/lib/mysql`. The `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable sets the database password from the Secret.

1. Web Application (Wordpress)
2. MySQl Database
3. Phpmyadmin
4. Kubernetes resources
    - ConfigMaps
    - Secrets
    - Deployments
    - Services (ClusterIP, NodePort)
    - Volumes (PV, PVC)

## What is MySQL ?
MySQL is a popular open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations. While MySQL is a specific database system accessible for free and supports various programming languages.

MySQL is a popular choice for managing relational databases for several reasons:

1. **Open Source**: MySQL is open-source software, which means itâ€™s free to use and has a large community of developers contributing to its improvement.

2. **Relational**: MySQL follows the relational database model, allowing users to organize data into tables with rows and columns, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. **Reliability**: MySQL has been around for a long time and is known for its stability and reliability.

4. **Performance**: MySQL is optimized for performance, making it capable of handling high-volume transactions and large datasets efficiently.

5. **Scalability**: MySQL can scale both vertically and horizontally to accommodate growing data and user loads. You can add more resources to a single server or distribute the workload across multiple servers using techniques like sharding or replication.

6. **Compatibility**: MySQL is widely supported by many programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It offers connectors and APIs for popular languages like PHP, Python, Java, and more, making it easy to integrate with your existing software stack.

7. **Security**: MySQL provides robust security features to protect your data, including access controls, encryption, and auditing capabilities. With proper configuration, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.



## What is PhpMyAdmin ?

phpMyAdmin is a free, open-source tool that allows users to manage MySQL and MariaDB databases. It's a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies tasks like creating, modifying, and deleting databases, tables, and records. 

Features:
- **Database administration**: Create, modify, and delete databases, tables, and records 
- **Run queries**: Run SQL commands to perform operations on a database 
- **Add user accounts**: Create and manage user accounts for a database 


## What is Wordpress ?

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites. It was originally designed for blogging but has since evolved to support other types of content. 

**Features**:
- **Plugins and themes**: WordPress has a large selection of plugins and themes that can be used to customize websites 

-**Integration**: WordPress integrates easily with other services, such as search engines, social media, and payment systems

- **News sites**: WordPress is used by many news sites 

- **Membership sites**: WordPress can be used to create membership 

- **Learning management systems**: WordPress can be used to create learning management systems 

## Project explained

- Persistent Volume (PV) is attached to the MySQL Database and used with a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) object.
- PhpMyAdmin is used for MySQL Database administration where we connect to the Database for creating/removing/updating items.
- PhpMyAdmin has access to the database by the internal service (ClusterIP).
- Users utilize PhpMyAdmin to administrate the MySQL Database. PhpMyAdmin, located in the cluster, is accessible through a web browser using an external connectivity service (NodePort).
- The webapp Wordpress communicates with the MySQL Database using an internal service (ClusterIP).
- Users use a web brower to get access to the webapp Wordpress in the cluster through an external service (NodePort).
- ConfigMap helps to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs such as the url to the MySQL Database.
- Secret stores sensitive data such as username and password for the MySQL Database and PhpMyAdmin.
